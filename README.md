# snake
 The goal of this project is to create a full fledge snake game in java, and then to consquently implement an AI/ML algorithm to beat the game. Am noob, so we're doing this on the fly. Thanks


TODO
 - Add better math to boundaries of the map.
   - Its worth noting that math, and english, are both hard. Do or do not, there is no try;
 
 AI/ML
 - Start entry level
   - Path Finding Algorithm given position (maybe update later without position given? to increase complexity?)
 - Next steps
   - Self Collision Avoidance
 
 Long Term
 - Make the code look prettier. Lots of examples of inconsistency
 - Snake movement can be instantaneously impacted by a keypress. Movement afterwords is then done on a shorter delay than normal.
   - Potentially adding in a restriction on how often the player can move the snake? AI might move the snake as infinitely as fast as possible (fun idea)
